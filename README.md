MapWars
=======

MapWars is an interactive strategy game developed for the Apple iPhone, as part of my class 491IP: iOS Development at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  It is a strategy game built on top of Apple maps, as the player you have to defend your real world location while fighting enemy AI units in the streets of your hometown.  Expand your radius over local businesses to gain tax revenue and fuel your war machine!

Developed by Christopher Paika, with constructive input on the ideas present in the game from our classroom discussion.
